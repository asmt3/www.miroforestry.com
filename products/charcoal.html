  We produce sustainable charcoal from our plantations in both Ghana and Sierra Leone and in our FSC chain of custody certified charcoal kilns.

  Our charcoal is of a high grade and is solely produced from Miroâ€™s sustainable, FSC certified plantations.
  We sell bulk and pre-bagged charcoal, and are able to supply in large volumes to local and export customers.
