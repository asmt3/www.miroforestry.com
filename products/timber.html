  Our modern thin-kerf sawmill technology allows us to produce a wide range of dimensions to precise measurements. We carry significant volumes of stock at all times enabling us to meet large orders at short notice. We can also produce to customers exacting specifications.

  Miro's timber comes from our sustainably managed  plantations. The timber can be kiln dried, planed or treated upon request.
