<p class="primary">
  Domestic demand for wood products is growing rapidly in Ghana, driven by a growing population (just under 30 million) and
  economic development. Ghana has undergone sustained growth averaging over 7% in the last 15 years and is forecasting to
  continue to enjoy GDP growth of over 7% in the next three years. As the World Bank states: ‘Ghana has evolved into a stable
  and mature democracy throughout the last two decades.’ Stability and economic growth have gone hand in hand with construction
  and increased demand for timber of all types.

<p>
  Rapid deforestation in West Africa has been a result of heavy logging and expanding agricultural land use patterns. The situation
  facing Ghana’s forest cover is dire: it stood at approximately 8.2 million hectares in 1900 but is now estimated at just
  1.2 million hectares, and current national estimates put the current rate of deforestation at an unsustainably high 65,000
  hectares per annum.
</p>

<p>
  At such a rate, Ghana’s forest cover will not last the next 20 years. While there is strong political support for reforestation
  projects, the national Forestry Commission has scarce resources and simply does not have the capital necessary to replant
  large areas of forest. The country requires significant private investment into the plantation forest industry to redress
  the imbalance.
</p>

<p>
  The Ghanaian government is seeking to preserve the rapidly dwindling natural forest resources, and encourage the rapid establishment
  of sustainable forest plantations and e cient sawmilling capacity within the country.
</p>

<p>
  The Company has established excellent relationships with the Government and the Forestry Commission, and has been able to
  lease degraded forest lands for the establishment of commercial, sustainable forestry plantations. As such, there is a
  very strong commercial opportunity to develop fast growing timber plantations to supply both the domestic and export markets.
