<p class="primary">
  Domestic demand for wood products is growing rapidly in Ghana, driven by a growing population (just under 30 million) and
  economic development. Ghana has undergone sustained growth averaging over 7% in the last 15 years and is forecasting to
  continue to enjoy GDP growth of over 7% in the next three years. As the World Bank states: ‘Ghana has evolved into a stable
  and mature democracy throughout the last two decades.’ Stability and economic growth have gone hand in hand with construction
  and increased demand for timber of all types.
</p>


<p>
  Rapid deforestation in West Africa has been a result of heavy logging and expanding agricultural land use patterns. The situation
  facing Ghana’s forest cover is dire: it stood at approximately 8.2 million hectares in 1900 but is now estimated at just
  1.2 million hectares, and current national estimates put the current rate of deforestation at an unsustainably high 65,000
  hectares per annum.
</p>

<p>
  At such a rate, Ghana’s forest cover will not last the next 20 years. While there is strong political support for reforestation
  projects, the national Forestry Commission has scarce resources and simply does not have the capital necessary to replant
  large areas of forest. The country requires significant private investment into the plantation forest industry to redress
  the imbalance.
</p>

<p>
  The Ghanaian government is seeking to preserve the rapidly dwindling natural forest resources, and encourage the rapid establishment
  of sustainable forest plantations and e cient sawmilling capacity within the country.
</p>

<p>
  The Company has established excellent relationships with the Government and the Forestry Commission, and has been able to
  lease degraded forest lands for the establishment of commercial, sustainable forestry plantations. As such, there is a
  very strong commercial opportunity to develop fast growing timber plantations to supply both the domestic and export markets.

<ul>
  <li>
    Ghana is a peaceful democratic republic formed in 1957 from the merger of the British Gold Coast colony and the British Togoland
    trust territory becoming the first sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Politically and economically stable, Ghana’s GDP has risen at over 7% per annum over the last 10 years
  </li>
  <li>
    The Financial Times, The Economist, the US State Department, the UN Trade & Development Agency and the World Bank all rank
    Ghana as one of the most stable and business-friendly countries in Africa.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ghana is ranked the 3rd most peaceful country in sub-Saharan Africa by the Vision of Humanity Global Peace Index and Ghana’s
    protection of business investors is comparable to what is found in OECD countries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ghana is a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) providing immediate access to all ECOWAS markets
    with a total population of 220 million people.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most of Ghana’s 238,000 square kilometres is savannah and savannah woodland, which covers 156,000 square kilometres and
    has never been a source of commercial timber for export. The natural high forest zone is in the south-western and southern
    regions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The discovery of the Jubilee Oil Field off the coast of Ghana in 2007, reported to contain 3 billion barrels, has now started
    to produce oil in commercial quantities, further driving economic development.
