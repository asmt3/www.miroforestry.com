title: Boumfoum, Ghana

<p class="primary">
  The Boumfoum Plantation consists of over 10,000 hectares of fertile land located in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The Company’s land is located about 10 minutes drive from the town of Agogo and about one hour from Kumasi.
</p>

<p>
  The plantation is around 7° north of the equator and has a tropical climate with average monthly temperatures ranging between 24°C and 28°C and annual rainfall between 1,300 - 1,650mm. The rains predominantly fall in May, June, July and September with the driest hottest months being December through to March.
</p>

<p>
  The land on which the company is establishing plantation forests was severely degraded during the 1980s and 1990s by agricultural clearing and heavy logging. The land has been designated a forestry reserve, and the Ghanaian Forestry Commission are very supportive of foreign investment being deployed to reforest the area.
</p>

<p>
  The Company works in close consultation with local subsistence farmers in the area aiming to deliver mutual benefit through education and controlled agro-forestry practice.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the soils are well drained and considered ideal for tree crops such as Eucalyptus. The land areas not planted by the Company currently hold a canopy cover of less than 5% and show a dominance of secondary growth species such as elephant grass, characteristic of the transition zone, and is ideally suitable for growing both indigenous and commercial timber species.
