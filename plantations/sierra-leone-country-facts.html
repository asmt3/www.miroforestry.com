title: Sierra Leone, Country Facts 
---

<p class="primary">
  Sierra Leone’s economy has been developing rapidly in recent years. The World Bank expects continued expansion for the foreseeable
  future, forecasting GDP growth above 5% per annum for the next three years. Since the Ebola crisis in 2014, economic growth
  has resumed and remains upward, supported by new investments in mining, agriculture, and fisheries. Growth, according to
  International Monetary Fund projections, is expected to remain sustainable over the medium term.
</p>

<p>
  Sierra Leone is estimated to have a total forest cover of approximately 2.75 million hectares (c.38% of the land area) and
  a historical deforestation rate in excess of 3% per annum. Until 2002, Sierra Leone lacked a forest management system due
  to civil war, however on paper there are now 55 protected areas covering approximately 4.5% of Sierra Leone.
</p>

<p>
  The country has 2,090 known species of higher plants, 147 mammals, 626 birds, 67 reptiles, 35 amphibians, and 99 fish species.
  While the country’s political will to protect and conserve its remaining forest is strong, the government has very scarce
  resources with which to do so. Financial investment into the private plantation forestry sector is vital for the future
  supply of sustainable timber.

<ul>
  <li>
    Sierra Leone is one of few countries in Africa with a fully-functioning multiparty democracy. Since 2002, free elections
    have been held every 5 years; in 2007, the governing party lost and handed over power peacefully to the current administration
    under President Ernest Bai Koroma. Both leading parties are fully committed to democracy and a probusiness environment.
    Sierra Leone has been ranked as the most improved country in Africa in both the Mo Ibrahim Africa Governance Index and
    the World Bank’s global Governance Indicators

  </li>
  <li>
    Significant fiscal incentives to investors in plantation forestry
  </li>
  <li>
    Sierra Leone is free of any major ethnic, religious, ideological or other disputes. Crime rates are extremely low; Freetown
    is one of the safest capital city in Africa, and the police force is one of few that does not carry guns
  </li>
  <li>
    Strong economic performance with continued GDP growth, steadily declining inflation, and relatively stable exchange rates
  </li>
  <li>
    As a former businessman, President Koroma is focused on encouraging investment and private enterprise and continued streamlining
    of the “costs of doing business”. Over the last 3 years, Sierra Leone has climbed 20 places in the World Bank’s Doing
    Business Report. The country ranks top in West Africa for ease of starting a new business, and anti-corruption laws and
    institutions are among the toughest in Africa.
