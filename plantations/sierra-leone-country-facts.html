<p class="primary">
  Sierra Leone is one of the few countries in Africa with a fully-functioning multiparty democracy. Since 2002, free elections have been held every five years; in 2007, and again in 2017, the governing party lost and handed over power peacefully to the main opposition party, with elections deemed to be free, fair and credible by international observers. Both leading parties are fully committed to democracy and a pro-business environment. Sierra Leone has been ranked as the most improved country in Africa in both the Mo Ibrahim Africa Governance Index and the World Bank's global Governence Indicators.

<p>
  Sierra Leone is estimated to have a total forest cover of approximately 2.75 million hectares (c.38% of the land area) and
  a historical deforestation rate in excess of 3% per annum. Until 2002, Sierra Leone lacked a forest management system due
  to civil war, however on paper there are now 55 protected areas covering approximately 4.5% of Sierra Leone.
</p>

<p>
  The country has 2,090 known species of higher plants, 147 mammals, 626 birds, 67 reptiles, 35 amphibians, and 99 fish species.
  While the country’s political will to protect and conserve its remaining forest is strong, the government has very scarce
  resources with which to do so. Financial investment into the private plantation forestry sector is vital for the future
  supply of sustainable timber.
